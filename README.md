**Introduction.** The construction sector contributes significantly to environmental impact. The large amounts of materials used by the industry and the poor energy performance of buildings lead to a very negative effect on environmental sustainability. Therefore, carefully selecting building materials can help reduce the overall environmental impact. In particular, retrofitting existing buildings with bio-based materials can act as carbon storage by trapping the CO2 that plants absorb during the growth phase. In addition, most natural materials have thermal performance comparable to their synthetic counterparts. Thus, good building thermal insulation and high indoor air quality and comfort could also be ensured by adopting new construction paradigms, reducing energy consumption.  
**Materials and methods.** This study sought to evaluate the potential for mitigating climate change through the use of bio-based building materials for the renovation of vernacular Italian-built stock. To do this, we conducted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis for a real case study on a retrofitting project on old dwellings in Italy. The results obtained for the case studies were then scaled-up to the entire Italian building stock. In this way, we evaluated the impact on climate change associated with the production of the materials, the carbon stored in the bio-based materials, and the potential environmental impacts reduction from reduced energy requirements.  
**Results and discussion.**  
**Conclusions and future development.**
