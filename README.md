### _Brief description of the work:_
_**Introduction.**_ The construction industry stands as a primary energy consumer and a significant emitter of Greenhouse gases, making a substantial environmental impact. The industry's extensive material usage coupled with inadequate building energy efficiency compounds the detrimental effects on the environment. Notably, the energy performance of buildings within the Italian built-stock registers particularly low figures. In fact, a closer examination of energy certifications issued in 2021 reveals that 34% of these certifications fall into the G class. Therefore, carefully selecting building materials can help reduce the overall environmental impact. In particular, retrofitting existing buildings with bio-based materials can act as carbon storage by trapping the CO2 that plants absorb during the growth phase. In addition, most natural materials have thermal performance comparable to their synthetic counterparts. Thus, good building thermal insulation and high indoor air quality and comfort could also be ensured by adopting new construction paradigms, reducing energy consumption.  
_**Materials and methods.**_ This study aimed to assess the potential for climate change mitigation by utilizing bio-based construction materials in the restoration of historic Italian-built structures. To achieve this goal, we conducted a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis in a practical case study involving the retrofitting of an ancient farmhouse in Italy, utilizing bio-based materials. Through this approach, we assessed the climate change impact associated with material production, carbon sequestration within bio-based materials, and compared it to a conventional scenario employing synthetic materials. The study considered a system boundary from the initial production stages to the use phase of the building.  
_**Results and discussion.**_  The findings indicate that adopting bio-based materials significantly diminishes the effects on climate change. Specifically, utilizing bio-based materials for the retrofitting project leads to an 85% reduction in impact compared to the conventional approach. This reduction is primarily attributed to the lower environmental impact during the material production phase and the biogenic carbon stored in these materials. If we consider the use phase, for the bio-based scenario, we can see that the impact due to energy consumption is the main contributor. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that the renovated building, which utilizes bio-based materials, exhibits good energy efficiency, exemplified by its A1 certification.  
_**Conclusions and future development.**_ Utilizing bio-based materials in retrofitting projects offers a promising approach for sequestering carbon and reducing the environmental impact of the construction industry on climate change. To further investigate the feasibility of the widespread adoption of these bio-based materials, it is essential to conduct consequential Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies to assess the production-related impacts comprehensively. Given the long life cycle of buildings, it would be valuable to examine the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions over time using a dynamic approach, incorporating variables such as maintenance activities. Lastly, for a more comprehensive assessment, it would be beneficial to evaluate various retrofitting projects and compare the diverse findings.
